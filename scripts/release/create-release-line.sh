# Create a release line: refs/heads/release/<X.Y>.x  (issue #3798)
#
# WHY A SCRIPT, AND WHY CREATION IS BLOCKED IN THE FIRST PLACE
# -----------------------------------------------------------
# Ruleset 20038606 ("Release branch protection") governs
# `refs/heads/release/[0-9]*.[0-9]*.x` with `pull_request`,
# `required_status_checks` (both contexts pinned to app 15368,
# `do_not_enforce_on_create: false`), `non_fast_forward`, `deletion`, and NO
# bypass actors. A required status check cannot exist on a ref that does not
# exist yet, so the very push that would create a release line is refused:
#
#   remote: - Required status check "Verify commits trace back to main" is expected.
#
# #3798 settled that this is the right posture rather than a bug, after both
# alternatives were tried and rejected:
#
#   * `do_not_enforce_on_create: true` does unblock creation -- but
#     `required_status_checks` was the ONLY rule blocking it (`pull_request`
#     never did), so waiving it left ref creation under `release/*` entirely
#     unguarded: any write-access user could push `release/<anything>.x` at any
#     commit, with no PR, no CI and no ancestry check. That is load-bearing
#     beyond untidiness -- the certified-release flow's safety rests on an
#     untrusted actor being unable to create a `release/*` ref at all. Applied,
#     demonstrated to be a hole, reverted.
#   * a standing bypass actor permanently weakens a branch class that is today
#     STRONGER than `main` (no bypass at all, pull request required).
#
# So cutting a line stays a rare privileged act that costs a deliberate,
# temporary, admin-only enforcement toggle. This script is that toggle done the
# same way every time: every precondition checked BEFORE anything is relaxed,
# the ruleset restored from an EXIT trap so it cannot be left relaxed, the
# before/after JSON diffed field by field, and an audit summary printed for the
# release PR or the issue.
#
# Deleting a release line needs the same toggle for the same reason: the
# `deletion` rule has no bypass actor either.
#
# THE MATCHING TEST-SUITE BRANCH (#4372)
# --------------------------------------
# The Release Gate is artifact-keeper-test's release-gate.yml@main, and every
# one of its jobs runs scripts/switch-tests-ref.sh (artifact-keeper-test#420):
# if that repository has a `release/X.Y.x` for the candidate's version, the
# suite runs from it, otherwise from main. Without the branch a maintenance
# candidate is gated by main's suite, which keeps gaining companion tests for
# features the line never gets -- that is what failed ten suites on the
# v1.10.2 candidate (#4350). So a line is created in BOTH repositories, the
# test branch at the suite commit that certified the line's first release:
#
#   --tests-from-run <id>  the successful Release Candidate run that certified
#                          v<X.Y>.0; the commit is the release-gate.yml sha
#                          GitHub recorded for that run (`referenced_workflows`)
#   --tests-sha <sha>      that commit, given directly (40 hex)
#
# The commit must be on artifact-keeper-test's main. artifact-keeper-test has
# no ruleset on `release/*`, so this is a plain ref creation, outside the
# toggle window, and nothing needs dispatching: the gate reads the branch when
# a candidate runs. It is idempotent: a test branch that already exists is
# left where it is (backported companion tests are cherry-picked onto it,
# artifact-keeper-test#424, so its tip legitimately moves), and re-running the
# script for a line whose backend branch already exists only creates the test
# branch -- which is how a failed test-branch creation is retried, and how an
# older line gets one.
#
# Runs locally, on a workstation, by a human admin -- so the messages here are
# plain text, not `::error` workflow annotations.
#
# Usage:  create-release-line.sh [--dry-run] [--tests-from-run <id> | --tests-sha <sha>] <X.Y> [<sha>]
#
# Env:
#   RELEASE_LINE_REPO        owner/repo   (default artifact-keeper/artifact-keeper)

usage: $(basename "$0") [--dry-run] [--tests-from-run <id> | --tests-sha <sha>] <X.Y> [<sha>]

Creates refs/heads/release/<X.Y>.x at <sha> (default: the commit tagged
v<X.Y>.0) by putting ruleset ${RULESET} into 'evaluate' for the length of one
API call and back to 'active' from a trap, then creates the matching
release/<X.Y>.x in ${TESTS_REPO} at the suite commit that certified v<X.Y>.0.

  --dry-run               run every check and print the plan; change nothing
  --tests-from-run <id>   the successful Release Candidate run that certified
                          v<X.Y>.0; the test branch starts at the release-gate
                          commit that run used
  --tests-sha <sha>       the test-suite commit, given directly (40 hex)

One of the two --tests-* options is required unless ${TESTS_REPO} already has
the branch. If release/<X.Y>.x already exists here, only the test branch is
created.
